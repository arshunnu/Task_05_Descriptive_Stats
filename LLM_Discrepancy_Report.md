# LLM Discrepancy Report (Prompt/Run 1 vs Run 2)

This document records a mismatch between the first and second LLM runs for the same dataset.
The first pass returned incorrect summary stats; the second pass corrected them after re-analysis.

## First Answers (incorrect)
- Games Played: 10
- Overall Record: 6-4
- Home Record: 4-1
- Away Record: 2-3
- Avg Goals For: 14.1
- Avg Goals Against: 10.6
- Avg Goal Diff: 3.5

## Second Answers (correct)
- Games Played: 15
- Overall Record: 9-6
- Home Record: 6-1
- Away Record: 3-3
- Avg Goals For: 13.73
- Avg Goals Against: 10.40
- Avg Goal Diff: +3.33

## Notes
- Root cause was likely parsing/selection ambiguity during the first attempt; on explicit re-analysis the model aligned with the ground truth computed by `stats_verification.py`.
- See `ground_truth_report.xlsx` for computed metrics from Python (Summary sheet).
